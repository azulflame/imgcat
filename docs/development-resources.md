# Development Resources

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The frontend is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The backend uses Node.js, connects to a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database, and utilizes AWS S3 for media storage.

To get started with development, refer to the project's build instructions (if available, otherwise standard SvelteKit development practices apply).
