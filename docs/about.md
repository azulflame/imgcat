# ImgCat

ImgCat is an open-source, meme-sharing community focused on users

## Background

Over the years, the internet has gotten prickly: Social media pushes toxicity, corporations strip-mine our personal data, and the sites we grew up with sold out. Our aim is to build something better, simpler, and less-toxic - built around users and the community we build, together.

## Core Principles

*   **Data privacy:** We apply EU-level privacy to all users.
*   **Simple feeds:** We use votes & views, not engagement models.
*   **Content controls:** Users decide the content they want to see.
*   **Moderation:** Users have powerful tools to shape their community.

## What Makes Us Different

The community. We are building robust controls allowing YOU to control your own feed, see the content you want, and ignore what you don't.

## What's the Catch?

The user-interface and tools are designed for sharing content, commenting, and interacting with the community. We can store albums of photos like Photobucket or Dropbox, but those are better tools for that purpose. We are community-driven.
