# How Will You Build a Better Site?

*   Build on the successes and community that Sarah (and many others) built. The user-interface, the tools, the functionality, etc. will be focused on supporting you as you post, comment, like, favorite and engage with the community.
*   **Better content controls.** Individual users will have better ways to control their own feeds, filter unwanted content, and see the content they want. We have a maturity spectrum, not a single yes/no flag.
*   **Better algorithms.** While users can boost, nerf, or block certain types of content on their own feed, the core algorithm is vote-driven by the community, not engagement models.
*   **Better privacy.** We have no desire to install tags, cookie-trackers, pixel-trackers, browser fingerprinting, advertising IDs, and all the junk that treats us as a product. We are ad supported, but will respect your privacy, and do things better.
*   **Respect for users.** I am a user, and I want my site to treat everyone with respect.
