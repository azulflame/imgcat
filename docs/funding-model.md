# Funding Model

*   I will not sell anyone's data.
*   I will not partner with a company that will.
*   I will not partner with a company that makes promises now, in return for profits later.
*   I do not believe free-tier, distributed or volunteered servers can work. The costs of storage and bandwidth are significant, and there are legal and compliance costs that require paid staff.
*   A fediverse could work, but it is a gigantic jump in complexity and time. I want to get server #1 done, live, and in your hands as soon as possible. But the code is open-source, and once it becomes stable, I would collaborate with other fediverse teams.
*   Selling subscriptions, taking donations, setting up a Patreon, etc. is a good path. But it will not sustain the whole site. There is a critical mass of views & votes required to make a site good. And free users are necessary.
*   Kickstarter won't work because the costs are ongoing, and the money would run out. Plus their terms require a physical/digital item to be delivered, not a donation.
*   Therefore... with all other funding options exhausted, the answer is ads. ImgCat will sell ads in order to feed the hamsters running the servers. The goal is to apply GDPR, opt-in privacy across the globe. But I do not know if this will cover costs. I will do my best, and be transparent with the community.
