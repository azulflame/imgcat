# Funding Model

## Core Principles

ImgCat is designed to push back against user-unfriendly trends in privacy and data collection. We believe a privacy-centric site is sustainable, and we are engaging with the community to make this happen. Transparency in our funding model is critical to building trust.

## Business Structure

ImgCat will be a non-profit foundation, covered under 501(c)(3) of the IRS tax code. Details will be provided later.

## Model

*   ImgCat will not sell anyone's data.
*   ImgCat will not partner with a company that will.
*   ImgCat will not partner with a company that makes promises now, in return for profits later.
*   ImgCat is not sure free-tier, distributed or volunteered servers are sustainable. The costs of storage and bandwidth are significant, and there are legal and compliance costs that require paid staff.
*   A fediverse could work, but it is a gigantic jump in complexity and time. Our first priority is to build a site, and get it into the community's hands. Once it becomes stable, we will collaborate with other fediverse teams and projects.
*   ImgCat will be a non-profit foundation and may take grants, donations, and various subscriptions. But it may not sustain the whole site. There is a critical mass of views & votes required to make a site good. And a large number free users are necessary to build that community.
*   ImgCat cannot rely on Kickstarter, or one-time fundraising because the costs are ongoing. Many fundraising platforms also require a physical/digital item to be delivered, and are not suitable for donations.
*   Therefore... with all other funding options exhausted, ImgCat will sell ads in order to cover costs. In keeping with out principles, the goal is to apply GDPR, opt-in privacy across the globe.

Once the site is stable and in the hands of users, we will evaluate the accuracy of our models. We suspect privacy-centric ads and non-profit funding sources will cover costs. And we will be transparent with the community.
